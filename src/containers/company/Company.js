            <p>
              Livestock industry of pig farms is shrinking. The decline and
              aging of the farm labor population, and the 3D industry have led
              to severe reluctance among young farmers and foreign workers, but
              they are experiencing many problems such as various malignant
              diseases

              High mortality and low productivity of domestic pig farms
            </p>
            <p>
              The mortality rate of pigs in Korean pig farms is close to 20%.
              Compared to farms in major overseas countries, the situation is
              two to four times more serious. Compared to overseas pig farms,
              Korean pig farms have lower recovery costs, so the quality of pig
              house management and facilities is relatively low. The
              productivity of Korea is 60% of that of overseas, and the input
              cost of feed is 1.5 times.
            </p>
            <p className="bold">Practical management issues in pig farms</p>
            <p>
              Due to the shortage of farm workers, there are difficulties in
              managing sows due to insufficient management of sows, lack of a
              respiratory disease (PRRS) management health status monitoring
              system, and early weaning piglets management. For example, during
              an outbreak of African swine fever in one region, more than
              430,000 pigs on 261 farms are culled per day.
